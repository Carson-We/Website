              Development Version (Alpha):
              <p>
                This version indicates that the software is in the early stages of development, focusing primarily on implementing software features. It is usually used internally by the software developers. This version may have more errors and defects that need further refinement.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Testing Version (Beta):
              <p>
                Compared to the Alpha version, the Beta version has significant improvements and resolves major errors. However, it may still have some defects that require testing and feedback for further improvement.
              </p>

              <p>
                The RC version is an important stage following the Beta version, indicating that the software has entered the final testing phase and may become a candidate for the official release. At this stage, the software usually eliminates most known errors and defects and meets the expected functionality and quality requirements.
              </p>
